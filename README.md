# EventGallery - Photo Upload & Share

EventGallery is a simple PHP-based photo upload and gallery system.  
It is designed for weddings, parties, and other events where guests can easily share their photos.  
Images are displayed in a modern gallery with thumbnails, a lightbox viewer, and download options.  
Uploads can be attributed to authors and organized into multiple sections.
